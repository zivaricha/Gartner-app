# Gartner-app

Gartner-app is a web application which scrapes linkedin public profiles. Given the URL of the profile, it scrapes the name,
current title, current position, summary, skills, experience and education and saves them to a database.
The saved profiles are then searchable through a search api based on the first 5 fields.
